# LINE CHATBOT DESIGN

## GENERAL IDEA 
Here we prefer to develop a chat bot about news on corona virus. It would provide more functions about newly published announcements. We know now there are plenty of news about this virus recently. And Some news is true but some not. This chat bot hopes to help people get more accurate news. Depending on user’s special demand, it would return more detailed news, the authentic of grapevine, medical and living supplies. And while accepting other contents it should talk with users intelligently.

## DETAILS
When asked something by certain keyword and want to know more, just ask it and it would provide them several latest and most relevant news. And considering the truth of any grapevine, we hope to use a third party api to judge rumors. And furthermore we hope to find some relative information related to help users to identify. Besides, this bot hopes to communicate with others on topics fluently. When not asked about news it is supposed to give other relative responses. (If time permits, we hope it to recognize literal emotion and give positive react.)

When asked by material issue, we hope to provide a general market condition on the item users want. It would be divided into two situations. First, if the input is specific such as face mask, we hope to directly return a general degree of shortage and price. If they want further information, we would ask some necessary keyword, such as who it would be used for, where users want to buy it, what price they can accept and so on. Second, if input is vague, we try to judge and provide some relative recommends. For example, ‘I wanna something useful for this virus’, we may recommend some medical supplies.

## REALIZE
These functions above would be more detailed and this file would be updated with some changes. This time we use line to do this chat bot. It provides file(in fact photos and videos), text, sticker, location, card share and so one. Technically we hope to react to all these possible input and take advantage of these types to give diverse feedback. 

When we do this project, we would firstly realize the function of return proper result when give some keywords and work on extracting keywords then, To get user’s idea, we would analyse input first, if the information we get isn’t accurate or enough, our bot may ask user relative problems to get more useful words or give certain supposed answer to ask if what they want is this.

## VERSION PLAN TILL MILESTONE 2
Version 1.0(Planned for Milestone 2)
We hope our robot could judge different demands from words and analyse keywords from an input and give relative news information(news recommend and rumor judge).
